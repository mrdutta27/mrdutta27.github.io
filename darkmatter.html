								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>I am exploring the use of <b>superfluid liquid helium-4</b> as a viable candidate for the detection of dark matter particles, specifically <b>weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS)</b>. As opposed to liquid xenon detectors operated by the McKinsey Research Group, currently in use in the LUX and LZ experiments in South Dakota, liquid helium detectors can detect low mass WIMPS using the crystalline structure of the super fluid with much greater precision. My focus is on coding Monte Carlo simulations, using the <b>Python</b> programming language, to create optimality conditions for the detection of light WIMPS using energy kinematics and probabilistic functions.</p><p>Under the mentorship of <b>Dr. Scott Hertel</b>, Postdoctoral Associate, and <b>Dr. Daniel McKinsey</b>, Professor of Physics</p>
								<h3>Dark Matter</h3>
								<p>As we looked out into the depths of the universe with modern technology, we discovered, astoundingly, that ordinary baryonic matter – the kind that makes up all of the matter we are familiar with, the kind made of protons and neutrons – is not the primary component in our universe. It’s not even half! Rather, almost <b>85%</b> of the universe is made of this new form of matter yet to be detected. So far, it has been invisible to us, hence the name "<b>dark matter</b>,” but scientists are trying to shed some light on it now. Understanding dark matter could be the key to understanding the construction of our universe, and dictate how forces and interactions play out on colossal scales.</p>
								<h3>Current Theories and Predictions</h3>
								<p>The evidence for dark matter came from multiple astronomical observations in the late 20th century. Unlike most massive objects in the night sky, dark matter (unsurprisingly) does not interact strongly with the electromagnetic force, and therefore does not emit light (thereby effectively invisible to us). However, it does have gravitational effects, and multiple observations of these effects, including gravitational lensing and rotational velocity, have given us an introductory glimpse at the properties of dark matter.</p><p> Data from multiple events, such primordial nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, structure formation, and microlensing observations, show that dark matter cannot be made of baryons or neutrinos. This implies that the Standard Model of particle physics cannot account for such matter, and therefore new physics must be discovered. </p> <p> One promising theory currently under investigation is <b>supersymmetry (SUSY)</b>. Supersymmetry is a theoretical symmetry between fermions and bosons that allow particles in certain states to have a “superpartner,” and thereby adding new particles to the Standard Model. Using the supersymmetry argument, scientists have theorized the existence of <b>weakly interacting massive particles</b>, or <b>WIMPS</b>, as a likely candidate for dark matter, and many direct detection experiments have now been designed to search for these particles.</p>
								<h3>Advantages of Liquid Helium and WIMP Detection Zone</h3>
								<p>Recent direct dark matter detectors, including <b>XENON100, LUX, and LZ,</b> have all been targeting higher mass WIMPS using the heavy liquid Xenon as the target medium. As a high mass medium, Xenon shows promise in the theoretical detection of more massive WIMPS above 10 GeV, but cannot detect low mass WIMPS from 1-10 GeV. Using liquid helium, we can fine-tune the detector to target these WIMPS in particular, and progress using known physics in superfluidity.</p><p> The use of liquid helium offers an added benefit: energy is transmitted in superfluid helium through quasiparticles in the form of sound and heat. Once they reach a surface with vacuum above, they undergo a process known as quantum evaporation. This thermal effect can be measured by digital bolometers as a continuous distribution, extremely useful for detecting minute changes that quantized detectors cannot. Although the physics of liquid helium is not fully known yet, we can be sure that it holds lots of promise for the future of particle detectors.</p>
								<h3>Nuclear and Electron Recoils</h3>
								<p>A fundamental method of detecting a dark matter signal in a direct dark matter detector is the discrimination of nuclear and electron recoil signals. In liquid helium, the helium-4 atoms are enclosed in an electron cloud shield. This charged shield is the source of all major atom interactions in the medium, as it directly interacts with other atoms and all electrically-charged sources. Thus, interactions with this cloud are known as <b>electron recoils</b>. However, if there are particles that are not electrically charged, they end up ignoring the electron cloud, and instead interact directly with the nucleus through <b>nuclear recoils</b>. There are only two types of particles (that we have accounted for) that can perform a nuclear recoil: neutrons and dark matter particles (theorized). Therefore, if we can discriminate between electron and nuclear recoils in the detector, and remove all neutron sources from the detector, we will be able to directly observe dark matter events.</p>
								<h3>Quasiparticle Physics and Interactions</h3>
								<p>One of the most crucial aspects of this research project are the energy interactions that take place inside the liquid helium. In superfluid liquid helium 4He, all energy can be expressed in the form of low-lying elementary excitations, or “quasiparticles,” in the form of phonons, and R-and R+ rotons. (Landau) It is theorized that different quasiparticles are produced and expelled in liquid helium by nuclear recoils and electron recoils. I am attempting to model and understand this discrimination more thoroughly, and determine whether it will allow us to build an effective dark matter detector.</p>
								<p>The first four weeks of the summer were spent in literature research and review, looking at all the current developments in quasiparticle interaction from the last twenty years, in particular interactions with solid surfaces, and the process of “quantum evaporation” (the main process which allows us to collect thermal data). Recent advances by an Ukranian Team (Adamenko, Nemchenko, and Tanatatarov) in 2010, in conjunction with developments made by leaders in the field of liquid helium (Feynman, Wyatt, Tucker, Dalfovo, Sobnack, etc.) allowed us to create theoretical models for all possible quasiparticle interactions, and gave us the physical tools needed to create a simulation.</p>
								<h3>Monte Carlo Simulations</h3>
								<p>Once the underlying physical concepts were (more or less) understood, I embarked on the task of creating models to more thoroughly explore this scenario in a real detector. My simulations were coded using the Python language, and run on the NERSK supercomputer cluster at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the High Performance Cluster at Yale University.</p>
								<p>Initially, I began with simple, ballistic models of 100 particles in a cylindrical container bouncing around with three degrees of freedom. Once my program was tested for proof of concept, I began adding physics constraints to the individual particles, including interactions at the solid interface (reflection/transmission probabilities, mode change probabilities, angle changes/dependences, etc) and quantum evaporation at the surface of the liquid helium. Finally, I added a sensor apparatus at the top of the device, to simulate thermal bolometers (digital thermometers) that would be used in an actual detectors. My final simulation was run for 60 hours on all three supercomputer clusters, totaling nearly <b>1 million</b> simulated quasiparticles.</p>
								<h3>Results</h3>
								<p>After careful analysis of the data, my simulations showed two important results:
								<ol>
									<li>The signals received by the bolometer apparatus showed a clear time-dependence for the phonon/roton excitation peaks, which is essential for electron/nuclear recoil discrimination. In addition, we saw the existence of a clear roton R-/R+ ratio, indicative of a spherical thermal distribution in the medium that will be extremely convenient to replicate for a working detector prototype</li>
									<br>
									<li>The initial location of the event was clearly, and surprisingly, preserved in the final data output. We experienced an unexpected focusing effect of the cylindrical container, which allowed for quasiparticles to converge on the sensor apparatus <b>directly</b> over the initial condition. This is extremely helpful for extracting information about the recoil interaction, and should a dark matter event be observed by this detector, we will be able to extract a large quantity of high quality information.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Further Steps</h3>
								<p>My lab group and I are confident in the significance of this finding, and are now working towards a publication to be released either this fall or spring.</p>
								<p>More careful analysis of the initial thermal conditions, and the resultant thermal distributions and consequences, must be taken into account through more rigorous analysis and complicated simulations. In addition, the discrimination between electron and nuclear recoils must be specified to a higher precision.</p>
								<p>Despite multiple efforts and ideas surrounding a liquid-helium based dark matter detector, this is the first time serious, data-driven work has been conducted in this regard. The possibilities for this technology include discovering a dark matter particle for the first time, and unlocking secrets behind the enigma that constructs nearly three-quarters of all the mass in the universe. I intend to continue this work remotely for the next year, and may plan on returning to Berkeley next summer.</p>
