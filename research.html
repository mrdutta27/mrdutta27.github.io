								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>I am exploring the use of <b>superfluid liquid helium-4</b> as a viable candidate for the detection of dark matter particles, specifically <b>weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPS)</b>. As opposed to liquid xenon detectors operated by the McKinsey Research Group, currently in use in the LUX and LZ experiments in South Dakota, liquid helium detectors can detect low mass WIMPS using the crystalline structure of the super fluid with much greater precision. My focus is on coding Monte Carlo simulations, using the <b>Python</b> programming language, to create optimality conditions for the detection of light WIMPS using energy kinematics and probabilistic functions.</p><p>Under the mentorship of <b>Dr. Scott Hertel</b>, Postdoctoral Associate, and <b>Dr. Daniel McKinsey</b>, Professor of Physics</p>
								<h3>Dark Matter</h3>
								<p>As we looked out into the depths of the universe with modern technology, we discovered, astoundingly, that ordinary baryonic matter – the kind that makes up all of the matter we are familiar with, the kind made of protons and neutrons – is not the primary component in our universe. It’s not even half! Rather, almost <b>85%</b> of the universe is made of this new form of matter yet to be detected. So far, it has been invisible to us, hence the name "<b>dark matter</b>,” but scientists are trying to shed some light on it now. Understanding dark matter could be the key to understanding the construction of our universe, and dictate how forces and interactions play out on colossal scales.</p>
								<h3>Current Theories and Predictions</h3>
								<p>The evidence for dark matter came from multiple astronomical observations in the late 20th century. Unlike most massive objects in the night sky, dark matter (unsurprisingly) does not interact strongly with the electromagnetic force, and therefore does not emit light (thereby effectively invisible to us). However, it does have gravitational effects, and multiple observations of these effects, including gravitational lensing and rotational velocity, have given us an introductory glimpse at the properties of dark matter.</p><p> Data from multiple events, such primordial nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, structure formation, and microlensing observations, show that dark matter cannot be made of baryons or neutrinos. This implies that the Standard Model of particle physics cannot account for such matter, and therefore new physics must be discovered. </p> <p> One promising theory currently under investigation is <b>supersymmetry (SUSY)</b>. Supersymmetry is a theoretical symmetry between fermions and bosons that allow particles in certain states to have a “superpartner,” and thereby adding new particles to the Standard Model. Using the supersymmetry argument, scientists have theorized the existence of <b>weakly interacting massive particles</b>, or <b>WIMPS</b>, as a likely candidate for dark matter, and many direct detection experiments have now been designed to search for these particles.</p>
								<h3>Advantages of Liquid Helium and WIMP Detection Zone</h3>
								<p>Recent direct dark matter detectors, including <b>XENON100, LUX, and LZ,</b> have all been targeting higher mass WIMPS using the heavy liquid Xenon as the target medium. As a high mass medium, Xenon shows promise in the theoretical detection of more massive WIMPS above 10 GeV, but cannot detect low mass WIMPS from 1-10 GeV. Using liquid helium, we can fine-tune the detector to target these WIMPS in particular, and progress using known physics in superfluidity.</p><p> The use of liquid helium offers an added benefit: energy is transmitted in superfluid helium through quasiparticles in the form of sound and heat. Once they reach a surface with vacuum above, they undergo a process known as quantum evaporation. This thermal effect can be measured by digital bolometers as a continuous distribution, extremely useful for detecting minute changes that quantized detectors cannot. Although the physics of liquid helium is not fully known yet, we can be sure that it holds lots of promise for the future of particle detectors.</p>
								<h3>Quasiparticle Monte Carlo Simulations</h3>
								<p>My work is focused on developing Monte Carlo simulations of quasiparticle interactions in a liquid-helium based detector given a set of initial conditions to optimize the detection of theoretical WIMPS in the medium, as well as discern the patterns and conditions that a resulting interaction would produce. This will provide a background expectation for a future experimental test.</p><p> The simulation is coded in the <b>Python</b> programming language using the Numpy, SciPy, and MatPlotLib packages. The code will be published on GitHub at the time of publication.</p>
